                  h3.heading.heading-sml.primary-color.launchaco-builder-hoverable.black What made you develop Helperbird?
                  p.paragraph_features At my first week #[a( href='http://www.teamwork.com' ) Teamwork.com] I was encourage to build anything I wanted. I decided to make a simple extension for the font #[a( href='http://www.opendyslexic.org' ) OpenDyslexic] to help Dyslexic readers like myself have a font option on webpages that were hard to read.

                  
                  h3.heading.heading-sml.primary-color.launchaco-builder-hoverable.black When were you diagnosed?
                  p.paragraph_features People suspected I was dyslexic when I was around 8, but I was officially diagnosed at 15 when I was struggling in school. One of my teachers told my parents that I should just drop out of school and my Mom pursued getting me tested to help find a solution for me. Only 8 months after being diagnosed and starting to get the help I needed, I ended up winning my first technology award.

                  p.paragraph_features That teacher didnâ€™t sound very encouraging.
                  p.paragraph_features She wasnâ€™t haha.

                  h3.heading.heading-sml.primary-color.launchaco-builder-hoverable.black Did you have any teachers that left a positive impact?

                  p.paragraph_features Sean Foley was my Physics teacher and he was super encouraging and even helped me get my first internship. Definitely was someone who saw something in me and that was very reassuring at that time in my life.

                  h3.heading.heading-sml.primary-color.launchaco-builder-hoverable.black How did you come up with the name Helperbird?

                  p.paragraph_features I had a previous website called ProjectBird and ended up liking the bird theme I guess haha. And obviously the helper part came from how the app is designed to help people.

                  h3.heading.heading-sml.primary-color.launchaco-builder-hoverable.black Do you feel like thereâ€™s a stigma attached to dyslexia?

                  p.paragraph_features I I think there still is unfortunately. Everyoneâ€™s different and has different abilities, if there is an area in life that you struggle with, whether itâ€™s dyslexia or not, I donâ€™t think you should feel ashamed for seeking help. Everyone does the best that they can with what they are given, no matter who you are weâ€™re all in the same boat just trying to do our best.


                  h3.heading.heading-sml.primary-color.launchaco-builder-hoverable.black Looking back, any advice youâ€™d give to your younger self?

                  p.paragraph_features Bet on Fulham to get promoted haha. No but really Iâ€™d prob give myself the same advice Iâ€™d give to any younger person, if youâ€™re struggling with something donâ€™t stay quiet about it. Iâ€™d let them know that itâ€™s okay to ask for help and itâ€™s okay to even need help. Everyone needs help sometimes.
